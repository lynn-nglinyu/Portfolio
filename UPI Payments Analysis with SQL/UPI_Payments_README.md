This project analyzes a public dataset of UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions using SQL on Google BigQuery.
The goal of this project is to simulate real-world analytics tasks relevant to roles in fintech and payments infrastructure (e.g., PSPs, issuers, acquirers, card schemes).

The project covers key metrics such as transaction volumes, success/failure rates, user activity, hourly trends, and simulated financial roles.
